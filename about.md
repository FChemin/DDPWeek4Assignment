Welcome !

This site is providing a tool to compute the price of the rent.

We required you to provide your apartment details: first, the area; second, the number of rooms.

The result contains a table with a price fitted to our linear model and an upper and lower bound from a 95% confidence interval.

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the GitHub repo: https://github.com/FChemin/DDPWeek4Assignment
